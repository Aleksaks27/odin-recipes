        <li>Buttermilk</li>

        <li>Soak the chicken in the buttermilk until fully coated.</li>
        <li>Cover the wet chicken with the flour and seasoning.</li>
        <li>Add a generous amount of vegetable oil to a large pan and bring this to 
            a high heat.
        </li>
        <li>Carefully place the pieces of chicken one-by-one into the hot oil and allow both 
            sides of each piece to become crispy. Around 10 minutes should be enough for each.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked chicken onto paper towels to allow it to cool. This will also
